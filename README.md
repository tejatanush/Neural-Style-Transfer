# Neural-Style-Transfer
A Style Transfer Model is designed to apply the artistic style of one image onto another, blending the content of a target image with the visual characteristics of a reference style image. The model typically uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to separate and recombine the content and style features from the two images.

### Applications
* Neural Style Transfer is widely used to generate artistic images by combining the content of a photo with the style of famous artwork. This application allows users, photographers, and artists to create visually stunning results without manual editing or painting. By applying styles from famous paintings like Van Gogh’s Starry Night or Picasso’s Cubism, NST makes it possible to transform ordinary images into artistic masterpieces.
* NST can also be applied to videos, transforming every frame of a video clip to reflect a specific artistic style. This is particularly impactful for filmmakers, animators, and content creators who want to apply a unique visual aesthetic to their videos. When applied consistently across video frames, the output becomes a visually cohesive work of moving art.
* Neural Style Transfer can enhance the visual quality of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) environments by applying creative styles to virtual worlds or augmented content. It can convert ordinary objects or spaces in VR/AR into artistic scenes, providing more immersive and aesthetically pleasing experiences for users.
